This is Coin-@VERSION@ by Systems in Motion. Double-click on Coin.pkg
to start installation. If you do not want to use an installer, you can
find a package containing only the framework itself (called
Coin-@VERSION@-Panther-no_inst.dmg) at ftp://ftp.sim.no/pub/coin/bin/macosx.

If you intend to develop without using ProjectBuilder, you should  
also install the CoinTools package, which contains the coin-config
commandline utility, its associated man page, and its default
configuration. The coin tools are a convenience if you want to
build Coin applications from the Terminal, and are also needed
when compiling SoQt.

Note that this Coin framework has been built with gcc 3.3 and will
only work on Mac OS 10.3 "Panther". If you are using Mac OS 10.2
"Jaguar" (or want your applications to be compatible with Jaguar), use
the package named Coin-@VERSION@-Jaguar.dmg instead. Please make sure
to also read the relevant FAQ entry at
http://www.coin3d.org/mac/faq.html#gcc_abi

Check out http://www.coin3d.org/mac for information on how to get
started using Coin.

Enjoy!
