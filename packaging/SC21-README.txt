Welcome!

This is Sc21 1.0.2 by Systems in Motion. Double-click on Sc21.mpkg
to start the installation. 

The installer includes:

    - the Sc21 framework 
    - the Sc21 Interface Builder palette
    - the Sc21 documentation
    - the Sc21 examples
    - Coin 2.4.3
    - the CoinTools for Coin 2.4.5

By default, all of these will be installed, except for the
CoinTools. (You only need the CoinTools if you want to use SoQt.) You
can select which components to install by choosing "Customize" in the
installer's "Installation Type" screen.

Note that you need to use gcc-4.0 to build against Sc21 due to ABI
changes between gcc-4.0 and earlier gcc versions.

For more information, please read the relevant FAQ entries on the
Coin/Mac website.
