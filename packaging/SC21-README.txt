Welcome!

This is Sc21 V1.0 by Systems in Motion. Double-click on Sc21.mpkg
to start the installation. 

The installer includes:

    - the Sc21 framework 
    - the Sc21 Interface Builder palette, 
    - the Sc21 documentation
    - the Sc21 examples
    - Coin-2.3.0 
    - the CoinTools for Coin-2.3.0

By default, all of these will be installed, except for the
CoinTools. (You only need the CoinTools if you want to use SoQt.) You
can select which components to install by choosing "Customize" in the
installer's "Installation Type" screen.

Note that the Coin and Sc21 frameworks have been built with gcc 3.3,
meaning they should not be used in combination with any earlier
version of gcc. The frameworks are, however, built with
MACOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.2 to be deployable on 10.2 (Jaguar) or
later versions of Mac OS X. Please make sure to also read the relevant
FAQ entry at http://www.coin3d.org/mac/faq.html#gcc_abi
