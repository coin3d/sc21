Welcome!

This is Sc21 1.0.1 by Systems in Motion. Double-click on Sc21.mpkg
to start the installation. 

The installer includes:

    - the Sc21 framework 
    - the Sc21 Interface Builder palette
    - the Sc21 documentation
    - the Sc21 examples
    - Coin 2.4.3
    - the CoinTools for Coin 2.4.3

By default, all of these will be installed, except for the
CoinTools. (You only need the CoinTools if you want to use SoQt.) You
can select which components to install by choosing "Customize" in the
installer's "Installation Type" screen.

Note that due to ABI changes between gcc-3.3 and gcc-4.0, you have
to choose the right SDK depending on what compiler version you are
using. As a rule of thumb, this means:

  - Mac OS 10.4 "Tiger"     use Sc21-*gcc4.dmg
  - Mac OS 10.3 "Panther"   use Sc21-*gcc3.dmg

For more information, please read the relevant FAQ entries on the
Coin/Mac website.
