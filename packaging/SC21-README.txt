Welcome!

This is Sc21 V1.0 by Systems in Motion. Double-click on Sc21.mpkg
to start the installation. 

The installer includes:

    - the Sc21 framework 
    - the Sc21 Interface Builder palette, 
    - the Sc21 documentation
    - the Sc21 examples
    - Coin-2.3.0 
    - the CoinTools for Coin-2.3.0

By default, all of these will be installed, except for the
CoinTools. (You only need the CoinTools if you want to use SoQt.) You
can select which components to install by choosing "Customize" in the
installer's "Installation Type" screen.

Note that the Coin and Sc21 frameworks for Mac OS 10.4 "Tiger"
have been built with gcc 4, so they should not be used in
combination with any earlier version of gcc. However, the
frameworks are built with MACOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.3, so you can
deploy your Sc21 applications both on Tiger or the latest version
of Panther (10.3.9) .

The Coin and Sc21 frameworks for Mac OS 10.3 "Panther" have been
built with gcc 3.3, and should not be used in combination with any
earlier version of gcc. They are built with
MACOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.2 to be deployable on 10.2 (Jaguar) or
10.3 (Tiger).

Please make sure to also read the relevant FAQ entries on the
Coin/Mac website.
