SC21 is a framework to integrate the Coin library with the Mac OS X user     
interface. Its functionality is to display scenes rendered by Coin on Mac    
OS X, and to integrate a Coin render area in a Cocoa application. It is      
possible to interact with objects in the scene graph via mouse and           
keyboard. There is also a "viewer interaction" mode which allows the user    
to move the camera around the scene, pan to the left or right, or zoom in.   
                                                                             
SC21 follows the MVC paradigm commonly used in Cocoa applications, and       
provides two basic components for the application programmer to use: an      
SCView (a view that you can use to display a scene rendered in Coin) and     
an SCController (which handles actual Coin rendering etc.).                  
                                                                             
An SC21 custom palette for IB is provided for ease-of-use from within IB.    
The design of the public API follows the Cocoa conventions as far as         
possible. Extending the class hierarchy is possible with minimal effort.   

SC21 is not an So@Gui@ library. It provides some of the functionality
of these, but it is not modeled after the same structure and does not
have the same API.

Please see http://www.coin3d.org/mac/SC21 for more information about
SC21, detailed instructions on how to install the framework, a
tutorial, etc.

Enjoy!
