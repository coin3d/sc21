001  Viewport not set correctly 

     When the controller is not loaded from a nib file but
     instantiated programmatically, a manual [view reshape] is necessary 
     after connecting the controller to make sure the viewport is set
     correctly. This should be done automatically when the other
     Coin initialization takes place. Reported by kintel, writeup
