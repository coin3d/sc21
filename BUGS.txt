The following is a list of known bugs in Sc21. Note that some of these
are actually duplicates from Coin/BUGS.txt that are relevant to Sc21.

001 Offscreen rendering does not work.

    Sc21 uses NSOpenGL, while Coin offscreen rendering uses AGL.  When
    the current OpenGL context is an NSOpenGLContext (because we are
    using Sc21, but the offscreen renderer tries to access the current
    context using aglGetCurrentContext(), it will get NULL... Ka-Boum!

    Note that it is not a problem to use AGL for offscreen rendering
    while doing the onscreen rendering in NSOpenGL; it is really just
    the context handling that is the issue.

    The solution for this problem is to implement a more flexible
    OpenGL context store/restore "stacking" system, using callbacks to
    store and restore the current (onscreen) context.
