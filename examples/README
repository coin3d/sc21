This folder contains the following example programs demonstrating how
you can use SC21:

++ SC21Viewer

This is a simple viewer demonstrating how you can use SC21.
It shows you how to open an Inventor or VRML file from disk and
display it. It also demonstrates some ways to interact with 
the SCController via context menu actions and user interface
elements (like a checkbox). In addition, it contains an 
example on how to use the notifications sent by SC21. 

++ Viewtiful

Viewtiful is a little bit more involved example of how to create an
MDI (Multiple Document Interface) viewer with SC21. It includes
features such as:
 - Drag and Drop files to the viewer icon
 - Copy to pasteboard
 - New from pasteboard
 - Refresh model
 - Connection to services

++ NoNibViewer

This is a very simple example showing how to instantiate an
SCController from Objective-C instead of in a nib file.
