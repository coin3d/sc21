This is a simple viewer demonstrating how you can use SC21.
It shows you how to open an Inventor or WRML file from disk and
display it. It also demonstrates some ways to interact with 
the SCController via context menu actions and user interface
elements (like a checkbox). In addition, it contains an 
example on how to use the notifications sent by SC21.
