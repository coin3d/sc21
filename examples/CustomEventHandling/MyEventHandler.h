// MyEventHandler acts as a switch between two eventhandlers: It
// itself does not any eventhandling, meaning that all events are
// forwarded to its nextEventHandler. But the nextEventHandler outlet
// can be changed by calling the toggleModes: method, which switches
// between coinhandler and examinerhandler.
