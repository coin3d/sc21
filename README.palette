This is the ProjectBuilder project for creating the
SC21.palette. 

Note that the actual palette contents lie in ../framework. 
If you are compiling the palette yourself, you will probably have
to remove the *.h and *.mm files and add them to the project
again. If anybody knows how to make PB store relative paths
instead of absolute ones, please let me know.
